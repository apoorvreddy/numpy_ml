Implementation of Neural Networks in Pure Numpy Only

mlp-npy-20.ipynb notebook contains the implementation of a 1 hidden layer neural network in pure Numpy. I have implemented the gradient computations as matrix multiplications of the Flattened Jacobian Matrices, the way it is implemented in popular libraries such as TensorFlow in the sense of computational graphs.
